Space Mission Analysis

Course Description:

This course will provide a working knowledge in mission analysis and design, orbital mechanics, and satellite attitude dynamics and control. 

The first part of the course will cover the mission requirements process. The second part of the course will focus on spacecraft and payload design to meet mission requirements. The third part of the course deals with launch and operations

Course Purpose:

Familiarize the student with concepts fundamental to the field of space mission design, hardware development, implementation and operation.

Learning Objectives:

At the end of this course, the student should be able to:
1. Define the mission requirements process
2. Apply the process to a hypothetical mission
3. Specify spacecraft and payload design criteria
4. Identify launch, early orbit operations and supporting missions

Overview:

Elements of space missions are examined including orbits, spacecraft systems, launch vehicles, re-entry, operations, and mission management.  Emphasis is placed on understanding the underlying physical principles and the system engineering process used to select orbits, plan maneuvers, and accomplish preliminary design of spacecraft payloads/subsystems to meet mission requirements.  

Text:

	The text for SPCE 5045 is:

	Space Mission Engineering: The New SMAD; Wertz; ISBN-13: 978-	1881883159 or ISBN-10: 1881883159

	It can be ordered directly from the publisher, Astrobooks.com, at: 

	https://astrobooks.com/spacemissionengineeringthenewsmadsme-	smadwertzeverettpuschellavailablespring2011softcover.aspx

	or through Amazon, etc. The important detail is that it is The NEW SMAD, since there were 	previous editions titled “SMAD”.

	Last spring students had good luck calling Astrobooks.com directly at (310) 539-	2306.  Beware…the text weighs about 7 pounds so shipping might be somewhat expensive!!
