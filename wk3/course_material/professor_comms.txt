All;

I recognize that HW #3 is fairly involved so I have some "hints" that should help you relate the problems to the text and class material. Be super careful in #8.1 that you are using the correct equations as shown in Table 8-12.

All;

This week's HW #3 uses the aspects of spherical geometry to show how a satellite in orbit can relate to areas on the ground. Obviously this is important in designing any type of space mission that senses the ground or communicates with ground sites. Therefore, it is important that you understand the math involved so that you can use these tools when it comes time to design any type of space mission. Hence the hints I provided. Please carefully review the material in chapter 8 (and a brief divergence to Table 10-3).

All;

Sorry! For HW #3 part 1 use the equations in Table 8-11. Caution...if there is an error in one of the steps it may cascade through subsequent steps! If you end up with a solution that doesn't make sense, be sure the previous steps are correct.
