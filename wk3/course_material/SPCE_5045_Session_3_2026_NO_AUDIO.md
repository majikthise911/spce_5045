# Radiation Belts

![](img/SPCE_5045_Session_3_2026_NO_AUDIO_5.jpg)

# South Atlantic Anomaly



* Due to tilt of Earth’s axis and the solar wind
  * Van Allen radiation belts dip toward the south Atlantic area
  * The boundaries of the SAA vary with altitude above the Earth\. At an altitude of 500 km\, the SAA ranges between \-90 and \+40 in geographic longitude and \-50 to 0 in geographic latitude\. In this region\, the extent of the SAA increases with increasing altitude\.

# Health Hazards



* Ionizing radiation main hazard
* Three components:
  * Galactic cosmic radiation \(GCR\)
  * Radiation from trapped particles
  * Radiation from solar flare particles


# Health Hazards (cont.)



* GCR
  * > 0\.1 GeV protons\, electrons\, ions
  * Flux is higher over polar regions
  * Greatest during solar cycle  _minimums_
  * Shielding not very effective
  * Relatively low flux level
    * No serious health threat over short term
    * 5% to 10% total radiation in all orbits due to GCR




* Energetic protons trapped in radiation belts most significant source or radiation for satellites > 500 km\.
  * South Atlantic Anomaly worst
  * Solar cycle effects degree of radiation
  * Manned space flight avoids worst areas


Solar protons produce ionizing radiation

Worst for satellites passing above 50 degree latitude at > 3 Er

# GCR Effects

# Spacecraft Operations



* Explorer I first discovered radiation belts
* ATS\-6 had 20 kv static charge
* Geosync satellites have highest probability of surface charging
  * Photelectric effect
  * Plasma bombardment
    * Close to magnetosphere
    * Cannot bleed off charge


# Single Event Upsets



* Bit flips
* Can cause:
  * Damage to stored data
  * Damage to software
  * Halt processors
* Cause is direct ionization of Si by high energy ion passing through material
* Satellites < 4 Er also effected by radiation belts


# SEU Mitigation



* Selective choice of hardware
  * Rad hardened
  * Use older technology
    * Large feature size solid state memory
    * May not meet mission performance requirements
* Triple memory redundancy
  * Weight
  * Power
* EDAC memory and processors
  * Performed at regular intervals
* Regular processor resetting
  * South Atlantic Anomaly

* Need to determine relative geometry of objects on Earth surface from satellite
* Example:
  * Target coordinates on Earth
  * Satellite position vector

Example computations are based on the following: Circular orbit at  _H_  = 1\,000 km\,  _i_  = 50 deg\, orbit pole at 40 deg N\, 150 deg E\, ground station in Phoenix at 33\.5 deg N\, 248 deg E\, and minimum allowable elevation angle  _e_  _min_  = 5 deg\. “same” indicates that either the formula or value listed is the same for both approximations\.

# Mapping and Pointing Errors



* Mapping and Pointing errors are associated with s/c navigation; i\.e\. knowledge of 3 D position in space rel\. to fixed frame of reference \(Earth\)\.
* “Pointing” = orienting s/c at specific location or inertial direction
  * Include inaccuracies in attitude control and angular motion\.  Effects on mapping only  _during_  “exposure”\.
* “Mapping” = determining the geographic position of the  _look point_  of the camera\, sensor\, etc\.
  * Oblateness of Earth has greatest effect on target altitude\.  This plus uncertainty in attitude are greatest contributors to mapping errors\.
* Earth resource satellites need both
  * example: 10 sec error in observation time = 5 km in geo location


![](img/SPCE_5045_Session_3_2026_NO_AUDIO_43.jpg)

# Mapping Error Contributors

![](img/SPCE_5045_Session_3_2026_NO_AUDIO_44.jpg)

Major mapping error contributors include Earth oblateness and its effect on target altitude determination\.  Pointing at the horizon causes significant scale distortion and therefore mapping error\.  Must trade resolution and mapping accuracy for coverage\.

Note that in this figure \(1000 km satellite\) the most significant  error source is target altitude error\.

# Pointing Error Contributors

![](img/SPCE_5045_Session_3_2026_NO_AUDIO_45.jpg)

This example is for a 1000 km altitude satellite\.  Note the various contributors\.  Specifically\, how the  __pointing__   __error __ only weakly depends on satellite elevation angle\.

# Mapping and Pointing Error Formulae

![](img/SPCE_5045_Session_3_2026_NO_AUDIO_46.jpg)

# Pointing Accuracy Issues

Typically want payload FOV to be about 4 times the 3  pointing error\.  So\, a 1\-degree square FOV would be satisfied by a 0\.25 degree pointing requirement\.  Therefore\, drives choice of attitude stabilization systems \(horizon sensor plus gyro stabilization\)\.

With large pointing error need considerable image overlapping\.  Common to have pointing accuracy 10% to 20% of FOV\.
