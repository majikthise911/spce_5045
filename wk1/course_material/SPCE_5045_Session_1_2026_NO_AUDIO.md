# Space Mission Analysis

Chapter 1 of the text is at a very\, very high level for this class\.  However\, it sets the stage for much more detailed design discussions to follow\.

Be familiar with the TRL discussions for both hardware and software development as shown in Table 1\-1

NOTE: On the inside cover of the text is a website address and password to interactive tables\, figures\, etc\. If you see a notation such as          or        attached to the tables and figures I have included in the weekly material that is the indication that you should refer to the interactive material in the text by following the instructions on the text cover\.
